# Undecided

* Sometimes, you just don't know how to decide on something. Where should you go eat? What activity should you start first? These are questions
that some ask every day, and spend too much time thinking about.

* Well, no more do you need to be undecided! With the launch of this new website, you can let an impartial machine decide for you. Simply input
a list (or choose from our default ones), select a number of items to pick, and off you go!

* Our website is deployed at: undecided.surge.sh
